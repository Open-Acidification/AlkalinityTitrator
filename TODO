Pipfile:
Remove:
- keyboard
- pynput
- smbus2
- "rpi.gpio"?
- pyserial
- pep8
- pad4pi
- adafruit-blinka

Remove Class UIState:
 - changed the self._setNextState calls to self.titrator.updateState
 - removed (ui_state.UIState) from class prototypes
 - removed ui_state.__init__ from states (not used)
 - removed all imports of UIState
 - removed the class and its file

Updates to Titrator:
 - removed setNextState (Isn't used and doesn't make sense)
 - updated updateState to not need nextState
 - removed variable nextState (Useless)
 - changed _updateState to not be private
 - removed updateState call from handleUI (updateState is called directly in the states,
 no need for the state machine to constantly call this function)
 - updated names of function in state files and test files


Create user_value_test.py:
 - just do it
