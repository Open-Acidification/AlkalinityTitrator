Pipfile:
Remove:
- keyboard
- pynput
- smbus2
- "rpi.gpio"?
- pyserial
- pep8
- pad4pi
- adafruit-blinka

Remove Class UIState: COMPLETE
 - changed the self._setNextState calls to self.titrator.updateState
 - removed (ui_state.UIState) from class prototypes
 - removed ui_state.__init__ from states (not used)
 - removed all imports of UIState
 - removed the class and its file

Updates to Titrator: COMPLETE
 - removed setNextState (Isn't used and doesn't make sense)
 - updated updateState to not need nextState
 - removed variable nextState (Useless)
 - changed _updateState to not be private
 - removed updateState call from handleUI (updateState is called directly in the states,
 no need for the state machine to constantly call this function)
 - updated names of function in state files and test files

Create user_value_test.py: COMPLETE
 - create a handleUI test
 - create a loop test
 - create a UserValue test

Update user_value.py: COMPLETE
 - separate key.isnumeric() and key == "*"
 - remove self.inputs (Everything can be accomplished with just self.string)
 - remove key == "D" (Not listed as an option, already implemented as A)
 - change "if len(key) > 0" to "if len(self.string) > 0" (This is the correct implementation)
 - updated key == "*" so that "0." appears if no number was entered before (Better UI)
 - remove self.instructions_1 (Does not make sense to have variable for this, doesnt follow standard)
 - remove self.instructions_2 (Does not make sense to have variable for this, doesnt follow standard)
 - remove self.subState (Is not used)
 - updated user_value_test to reflect these changes
 - # TODO: Return to a variable in the titrator class???

Update initial_titration.py: Complete
 - Move "if self.choice" (should be in handleUI, follows a standard)
 - Further improvements could possibly be made
 - initial_test updated to reflect changes

Update setup_titration.py: Complete
 - Removed def start (Not used)

 Update read_volume.py: Complete
 - Removed subState (Not used)
 - Removed self.Values (Not used)

 Update set_volume.py: Complete
 - Removed self.Values (Not used)

 Update toggle_test_mode.py: Complete
 - Removed self.subState (Not used)
 - Removed self.values (Not used)

Update setup_calibration.py:
 - Removed self.subState (Not used)

 Remove constants.key:
 - Update keys to be actual value (Improves Readability)
 - Removed severals files' import constants
 - Update tests to reflect these changes

Update calibrate_temp.py:
 - Removed expected temperature (Not used)

Update manual_titration.py:
 - Removed def start (Not Used)

Update update_settings.py:
 - Updated for more robust conditional statements (Better UX)




What needs to be implemented in order for titration:
 - User Value, Line 18: return entered string to someplace (database or state)
 - Automatic Titration, Line 32: Update Target PH
 - Automatic Titration, Line 48: Update Current PH
 - Initial Titration, Line 51: Fix Mock Temperature Controller and remove break
 - Manual Titration, Line 48: pop back up???
 - Manual Titration, Line 66, 74: Update current pH
 - Manual Titration, Line 90: Change exit and go to main menu
 - Read Values, Line 4: read from actual devices
 - Prime Pump, Line 4: feedback on number of pumps; one state? Use "D" to exit always, implement constant feedback on pumping
 - Main Menu, Line 61: change to LCD
 - Determine if we need LCD clear statements in our loop functions, lcd_interface.lcd_clear()
